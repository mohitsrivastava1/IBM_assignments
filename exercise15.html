	<p><b>JavaScript </b>often abbreviated as <b>JS</b>, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.



Alongside <b>HTML and CSS</b>, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.



As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports <b>event-driven, functional, and imperative</b> (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the <b>DOM</b>, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities</p>
